# FIFO-SYNCHRONOUS
A Synchronous FIFO is a memory buffer used for temporary data storage where both read and write operations are controlled by the same clock signal. 
Data written into the FIFO is read out in the same order in which it was entered ensuring data integrity and proper sequencing. 
A synchronous FIFO uses write and read pointers to track memory locations along with status flags such as Full and Empty to prevent overflow and underflow conditions.
